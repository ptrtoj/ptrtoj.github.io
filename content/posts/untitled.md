**Work in Progress**

This post tries to integrate various note-taking, journaling and task managment methods such as 'commonplace books', 'zettelkasten', 'bullet journal' or even 'PARA method'.

I'm trying to integrate both analog and digital method without duplicated items on multiple locations.

## Task Management

### Event

'Event' means a task which is already been set to take place in specific date and time.
This automatically goes into 'Digital Calendar'.

### Task

'Task' means a todo item which doesn't set to be take place in specific time or even date, but to be done.

## Note Taking

### Pen vs Typing

#### Pen > Typing Researches

A lot of the recent research on note-taking has been on whether taking hand-written notes or laptop notes are superior. The evidence for one being better than the other is a bit "meh". As mentioned, the idea that "verbatim notes are bad" seems less true for laptop note-takers.

The opening quote comes from:

Flanigan, A. E., & Titsworth, S. (2020). The impact of digital distraction on lecture note taking and student learning. Instructional Science, 48(5), 495-524. https://bit.ly/3RiWQWE

The second quote comes from:

Morehead, K., Dunlosky, J., & Rawson, K. A. (2019). How much mightier is the pen than the keyboard for note-taking? A replication and extension of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014). Educational Psychology Review, 31(3), 753-780. https://bit.ly/3CYdgzf

Experiment 2, here, is also the one that I relate where "no note-taking" performed just as well as any of the note-taking conditions on immediate tests. It's unclear to me why they didn't also use a delayed measure with the no note-taking group. Also, looking at tables 3 and 4, you can see that if students took notes on material germane to the test, then they did well (my second concluding point).

Another recent piece is here:

Luo, L., Kiewra, K. A., Flanigan, A. E., & Peteranetz, M. S. (2018). Laptop versus longhand note taking: effects on lecture notes and achievement. Instructional Science, 46(6), 947-971. https://bit.ly/3Qw24xb.

The introduction is a fair summary of the mixed evidence on the encoding hypothesis. Unfortunately, they only used immediate tests here, but there's some interesting material on the relative benefits of hand-written vs laptop notes.

Below is a more direct test of my suggested approach. The results? Note-taking beats testing on immediate tests, but in two weeks testing wins. Testing even beats note-taking + review, suggesting that the storage function of notes is not particularly strong.

And here is another that finds no difference, even though students who took notes during the lecture took more relevant notes than those who took notes after the lecture.

Haynes, J. M., McCarley, N. G., & Williams, J. L. (2015). An analysis of notes taken during and after a lecture presentation. North American Journal of Psychology, 17(1). https://bit.ly/3CUqAEL

And another old piece, same thing, no difference (only the measures weren't great).

Eisner, S., & Rohde, K. (1959). Note taking during or after the lecture. Journal of Educational Psychology, 50(6), 301–304. https://psycnet.apa.or...

Certainly students seem to believe that note-taking during lectures improves learning outcomes:
