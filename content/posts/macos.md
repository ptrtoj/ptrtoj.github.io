My 2Â¢ while using MacBook Pro.

### Homepage to Favorites

If you want to use `New Tab Page` as `Home Page`,
you can go to `Settings`, `Home Page` and enter `favorites://`.

Then you can go to `New Tab Page` on any webpage, with shortcut below.

Shortcut: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `H`

### Move between Tab Groups

I utilize `Tab Groups` rather than `Profiles`
(without any specific reason, just preference).
If you're like me, you will love this little shortcut which allows moving
between tab groups.

Shortcut: `CMD` + `OPT` + `UP/DOWN`
