My 2¢ while using MacBook Pro.

## Safari Related

### Developer's Tool

Webpage inspector also works on Safari(see: ["Apple Developer"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/enabling-developer-features))

1. Open `Safari` > `Settings` > `Advanced` > Enable `Show fatures for web developers` checkbox
2. [MAYBE] Restart Safari
3. `OPT` + `CMD` + `i` to open inspector

### Homepage to Favorites

If you want to use `New Tab Page` as `Home Page`,
you can go to `Settings`, `Home Page` and enter `favorites://`.

Then you can go to `New Tab Page` on any webpage, with shortcut below.

Shortcut: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `H`

### Move between Tab Groups

I utilize `Tab Groups` rather than `Profiles`
(without any specific reason, just preference).
If you're like me, you will love this little shortcut which allows moving
between tab groups.

Shortcut: `CMD` + `OPT` + `UP/DOWN`

## Keyboard Related

### Insert emoji with external keyboard

`CMD` + `CTRL` + `SPC`

### Change `CTRL` + `SPC` to `nil` for Emacs

`Settings` > `Keyboard` tab > `Keyboard Shortcuts...` button >
`Input Sources` tab > Uncheck `Select the previous input source     ⌃Space`

You can still change the input source with

1. `Select next source in input menu    ⌃⌥Space`
2. `Fn` + `Tab`, which input the `CapsLock` key in HHKB
3. `CapsLock`
